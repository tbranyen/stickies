Stickies are simple notes written in Github Flavored Markdown.

Inspired by the old-school Stickies application from Mac OS, Stickies2 gives a dead simple way to take a quick note, with room for a few bells and whistles, too.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Here are a few keyboard shortcuts to make things a bit easier:

* Press `Command-s` to sync with your Google Chrome Store account.
* Press `Command-p` for a markdown preview.
* Use `escape` to dismiss the preview
* Make a new sticky with `Command-n`.
* To **fork** the current sticky, use `Command-Shift-N`.
* Delte a sticky with `Command-Shift-d`.

## TODO Lists

You can also embed simple checklists in Stickies, much like in Github issues.

- [ ] In Preview mode, this is an unfinished TODO
- [x] And this is a completed one"
